# üõ†Ô∏è Line Follower Robot with PID Control using QTR Sensor Array

This is an Arduino-based line follower robot that uses an 8-sensor QTR-8A IR array and the SparkFun TB6612FNG motor driver. The bot features smooth and responsive movement using a PID control algorithm and supports calibration, gradual startup, and speed regulation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Calibration Phase:**
   - Press the calibration button before starting.
   - The robot calibrates the sensors to the line surface for 10 seconds.

2. **Start Phase:**
   - Press the start button to begin line following.
   - The robot ramps up, then follows the line using a PID controller.

3. **PID Control:**
   - `Kp`, `Ki`, and `Kd` values adjust how the robot corrects its path based on error from the center.
   - The correction adjusts left/right motor speeds to stay centered on the line.
